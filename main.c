 * This exercise is rather pointless in C given that on any CPU made in this millennium, there is support
 * for multiplication and division even with floating point numbers. However, this is not the case for Texas
 * Instruments. Their monopolistic stranglehold on the education market has resulted in an astonishing lack
 * of innovation in their graphing calculators, whose prices have not decreased at all over the past few
 * decades.
 *
 * Fortunately, since their CPUs are so simplistic, this is a great opportunity for me to learn how to program
 * them in assembly as the assembly languages used by modern processors are far too complicated. However, before
 * I jump straight into assembly, I am attempting to program these basic routines in C, because if I can't
 * even do that, then I am hopeless for assembly.
