# Bolfenstein-3D-no-multiplication
I am making a raycaster called Bolfenstein 3D (any similarity is purely coincidental) in C with the restriction that I can only use addition, subtraction, and low-level bit operations (and SDL).This exercise is rather pointless in C given that on any CPU made in this millennium, there is support  for multiplication and division even with floating point numbers.

However, this is not the case for Texas  Instruments graphing calculators. Their monopolistic stranglehold on the education market has resulted in an astonishing lack of innovation in their calculators, whose prices have not decreased at all over the past few  decades. Fortunately, since their CPUs are so simplistic, this is a great opportunity for me to learn how to program them in assembly as the assembly languages used by modern processors are far too complicated. However, before  I jump straight into assembly, I am attempting to program this in C with similar restrictions, because if I can't  even do that, then I am hopeless for assembly.
