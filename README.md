# Bolfenstein-3D-no-multiplication
I am making a raycaster called Bolfenstein 3D (any similarity is purely coincidental) in C with the restriction that I can only use addition, subtraction, and low-level bit operations (and SDL).This exercise is rather pointless in C given that on any CPU made in this millennium, there is support  for multiplication and division even with floating point numbers.

However, this is not the case for Texas  Instruments graphing calculators. Their calculators do not even have native instructions for integer division/multiplication. However, this works in my favor, because this is a great opportunity for me to learn how to program in assembly as the assembly languages used by modern processors are far too complicated. But before  I jump straight into assembly, I am attempting to program this in C with similar restrictions, because if I can't  even do that, then I am hopeless for assembly.
